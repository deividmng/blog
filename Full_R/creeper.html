                        The history of cybersecurity is not merely a chronology of malicious software, but a technological arms race that began as an academic experiment and transformed into one of the most critical challenges of the 21st century. According to Kaspersky’s historical archives, the origin of everything we know today dates back to 1971 with the appearance of <strong>Creeper</strong>. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unlike modern viruses, Creeper was not designed to destroy data or steal identities; it was created by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies as a proof of concept to demonstrate that a program could move between computers. Its message, <em>“I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!”</em>, marked the birth of the first computer worm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Shortly after, <strong>Reaper</strong> emerged, created for the sole purpose of seeking out Creeper and deleting it. This event is fundamental, as it represents the birth of the first "antivirus" or self-defense program, establishing a pattern that would define the industry for decades: for every new threat, a technological countermeasure arises.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        During the 1980s, the situation shifted from controlled experiments to real-world infections. In 1982, <strong>Elk Cloner</strong> became the first virus detected outside a laboratory, spreading via floppy disks on Apple II systems. However, the true turning point arrived in 1986 with <strong>Brain</strong>, the first IBM PC virus, which utilized "stealth" techniques to avoid detection. By the end of that decade, in 1988, the <strong>Morris Worm</strong> paralyzed a large portion of the nascent Internet (ARPANET), demonstrating for the first time the potential for large-scale attacks to collapse connected infrastructures.

                    <p>
                        The 1990s and the early 2000s marked the era of mass propagation through email. Viruses such as <strong>Melissa</strong> (1999) and <strong>ILOVEYOU</strong> (2000) leveraged social engineering to deceive millions of users, causing damages valued in the billions of dollars. These attacks proved that the human factor was, and still remains, the weakest link in the security chain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, the landscape has evolved into much darker and more sophisticated threats. We are no longer just talking about viruses that delete files for fun, but advanced <strong>Ransomware</strong> designed for economic gain through the kidnapping of critical data, and the use of Artificial Intelligence to create nearly perfect phishing attacks. Furthermore, we have entered the era of <strong>Cyber Warfare</strong>, where nation-states deploy malicious software to sabotage critical infrastructure, such as power plants or electoral systems.

                        <strong>The Final Lesson:</strong> Defense technology, such as firewalls and encryption, is vital, but user education is the only real defense. As experts conclude, in a world where malware is capable of mutating and hiding through AI, absolute security is an illusion; constant vigilance is our only option.
